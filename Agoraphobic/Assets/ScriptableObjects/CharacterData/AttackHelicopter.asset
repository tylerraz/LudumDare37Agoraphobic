  victoryParagraph: As the last invader dies at your feet, you realize that everything
    outside is actually dangerous. If you stay inside any longer, the world will crumble.
    Only you, beautiful Apache, with 30mm cannons and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, can
    stop the evil that lives in the outside.
